# Learn Vulkan
My way of learning Vulkan and hopefully some other game dev libraries

**This is not cross platform (Only Windows)**

---
## Setup
1. Clone this repo to your divice
2. Run the `Setup.bat` file, this initializes the git submodules
3. Run the `VS_Generate.bat` file, this will create all of the visual studio files
4. Open the .sln file in visual studio

#### Note
All vs files the `VS_Generate.bat` file creates are for visual studio 2019
